A member of the RailsConf 2025's program committee claimed via a Bluesky post that
plans for DHH's keynote was announced internally before review and selections began. 
A member of Ruby Central's board who is also a Shopify employee replied to this 
confirming that was the case, and that if PC members had a problem with that, 
they could resign from the committee. 

Can you confirm this sequence of events and provide clarification as to why things
were done in this manner? 

Additionally, can you explain what if any commitments
Ruby Central made to Shopify regarding programming for the event? In other words,
was a keynote featuring DHH a condition for sponsorship, either directly or
implicitly?
