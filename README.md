# Questions for Ruby Central

Immediately after DHH's RailsConf 2025 keynote was announced, Ruby Central announced 
and then conducted a listening session, with the promise that a recoeding would
be released afterwards.

That recording was never released, and no substantive summary of what was discussed
in that meeting was ever made public, either.

Fast forward a few months, and Ruby Central has yet again [taken actions that have
provoked community outrage](https://www.404media.co/how-ruby-went-off-the-rails/). 
They promised another listening session, and then prompty cancelled it.

In its place, a Google Form and a promise to write replies in future updates. In
essence, this is the digitial equivalent of a locked feedback box where you can drop a 
slip of paper with your complaint written on it and hope that the owner of the box
eventually considers your thoughts. But based on prior handling of community feedback, 
**this is not a way to build trust.**

But more importantly, *this is not how open source works.* For those who still
remember what the "open" in open source means, let's do this a little differently
and hope that it helps ensure that questions get answered.

## What to do

1) Send in your questions to Ruby Central about the recent actions they have taken via
[their official comment box](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdzz3Djtp8J-oHdI7IEzwqiIH8_2O1Ldc2e1OgEvRE7RWgdBQ/viewform?ref=rubycentral.org).

2) Immediately afterwards, send a pull request to this repository to add the same questions
(ideally in the exact form you sent them to Ruby Central) to the QUESTIONS.md file.

## Why record your questions here?

A public record creates an accountability measure and provides public visibility 
into who is asking what, and what questions get official responses and 
which are left unanaswered.

It's table stakes for open governance to have these conversations in the open. While we 
cannot mandate Ruby Central's own way of doing things, we can maintain a public record 
ourselves to hold the organization responsible for stewarding the most 
critical infrastructure of our community.
