# Questions for Ruby Central

Immediately after DHH's RailsConf 2025 keynote was announced, Ruby Central announced 
and then conducted a listening session, with the promise that a recording would
be released afterwards.

That recording was never released, and no substantive summary of what was discussed
in that meeting was ever made public, either.

Fast forward a few months, and Ruby Central has yet again [taken actions that have
provoked community outrage](https://joel.drapper.me/p/rubygems-takeover/). 
They promised another listening session, and then prompty cancelled it.

In its place, a Google Form and a promise to write replies in future updates. In
essence, this is the digitial equivalent of a locked feedback box where you can drop a 
slip of paper with your complaint written on it and hope that the owner of the box
eventually considers your thoughts. But based on prior handling of community feedback, 
**this is not a way to build trust.**

But more importantly, *this is not how open source works.* For those who still
remember what the "open" in open source means, let's do this a little differently
and hope that it helps ensure that questions get answered.

## What to do

1) Send your questions to Ruby Central about their recent actions via
[their official comment box](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdzz3Djtp8J-oHdI7IEzwqiIH8_2O1Ldc2e1OgEvRE7RWgdBQ/viewform?ref=rubycentral.org).

2) Immediately afterwards, send a pull request to this repository to add the same questions
(ideally in the exact form you sent them to Ruby Central) to the [QUESTIONS.md](https://github.com/community-research-on-ruby-governance/questions-for-ruby-central/blob/main/QUESTIONS.md) file.

## Why record your questions here?

A public record is an accountability measure and provides visibility 
into who is asking what, and what questions get official responses
from Ruby Central and which are left unanaswered.

It's table stakes for open governance to have these conversations in the open. While we 
cannot control [Ruby Central's own way of doing things](https://rubycentral.org/news/our-stewardship-where-we-are-whats-changing-and-how-well-engage/), we can maintain a public record 
ourselves to hold the organization responsible for stewarding the most 
critical infrastructure of our community to a higher standard of transparency.

## How to help spread the word

First of all, consider submitting a question. People generally only participate in
community organized activities once they see others they know getting involved,
so don't underestimate just how much impact being among the first few folks to
submit a pull request will have on encouraging others to participate.

You can also share a link to this repository wherever you post on social media,
or if you're on Mastodon, you can [boost this post](https://mastodon.social/@skillstopractice/115304277231471595) to get the word out.

Seeing a large amount of questions from many active community members in one place sends 
a strong message that people *do* care about Ruby's governance. It's a simple act
of civic service for a language we all love to show up and have our voices be heard.
